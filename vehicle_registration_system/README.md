# Vehicle Registration System

This Python project demonstrates multi-level object-oriented programming to simulate a vehicle registration system with cars and electric cars.

---

## ðŸ”§ Key Concepts:
- Inheritance (`Vehicle â†’ Car â†’ ElectricCar`)
- Regular expression validation for license plates
- Class & static methods
- Object creation via `from_string()`
- Object introspection using `__dict__`, `dir()`, `help()`

---

## ðŸš˜ Features:
- Validate license plate format (e.g., `ABC-1234`)
- Track total vehicles, cars, and electric cars
- Display all registered vehicles by type
- Add vehicles using user-like input strings

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Output:
The License Plate is valid.
Total Vehicles are: 1
Total Cars are: 1
Total Electric Cars: 1
{'owner': 'Sara', 'license_plate': 'XYZ-5678', ...}

## ðŸš€ How to Run:
```bash
python vehicle_registration_system.py
