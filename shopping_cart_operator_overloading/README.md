# 🛒 Shopping Cart System with Operator Overloading

This project simulates a shopping cart system using OOP in Python with extensive use of **operator overloading**.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- ✅ `__add__`, `__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__len__`, `__contains__` – all overloaded smartly
- ✅ Merging products with the same name
- ✅ Merging carts with logic to auto-combine matching items
- ✅ `from_string()` pattern used for flexible object creation
- ✅ Full `__str__` and `__repr__` coverage for both classes

---

## 🛍️ Example Features

- Add two `Product` instances together (if names match)
- Merge two carts using `+`
- Check total price of the cart
- Compare carts using `==`, `>`, etc.
- Check if a product exists in a cart with `in`
- Dynamically remove items
