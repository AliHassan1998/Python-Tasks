# 📚 Library System with Method Overriding and Dunder Methods

This project demonstrates a simple object-oriented library system using inheritance, method overriding, dunder (magic) methods, and input validation.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Inheritance**: `Book` and `Magazine` inherit from `LibraryItem`
- **Method Overriding**: Custom `borrow()` methods in child classes
- **Dunder Methods**: Includes `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, `__len__`
- **Regex Validation**: Validates `item_id` format
- **Class Tracking**: Keeps count of total items, books, and magazines

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python library_system_with_overriding.py

---

## 📄 Example Output Highlights
Borrowing the book 'Veronica decides to die' by 'Paul Cole'.
Borrowing magazine 'Tuesday Magazine', issue #15.
Class-level item tracking
Dunder comparisons: equality, length, and readable representations
