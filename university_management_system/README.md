# University Staff & Student Management System

This Python project demonstrates an object-oriented simulation of managing both university staff and student records, including validation and class tracking.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts:
- Inheritance (`Student` and `Staff` inherit from `Person`)
- Regex-based validation for emails and IDs
- `from_string()` alternative constructors
- Class-level tracking of all objects
- Introspection with `__dict__`, `help()`, `dir()`

### ðŸ§ª Features:
- Create and validate students and staff
- Store and display all records
- Count totals per class and overall
- Display details using formatted strings

### ðŸš€ How to Run:
```bash
python university_management_system.py

Sample Output:
The roll number is valid.
The Employee ID is valid.
Total persons: 4 including 2 students and 2 staff.
